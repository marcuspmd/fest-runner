# Implementation Complete: cURL Import/Execute Feature

## ✅ Feature Successfully Implemented

This document confirms the successful implementation of the cURL import/execute action button for the Flow Test Runner VS Code extension, as requested in the GitHub issue.

## 🎯 Original Request (Portuguese)
> "Na nossa extensão, quero que possamos ter alguns botões, antes da listagem dos tests, para que possamos ter alguns actions buttons para ações rápidas, tipo ter um botão para clicar e aparecer um input text para a gente poder inserir um curl, para que possa importar / executar automaticamente e trazer o retorno em um bottom panel, ou algo assim."

**Translation**: "In our extension, I want us to have some buttons, before the test listing, so we can have some action buttons for quick actions, like having a button to click and a text input appears so we can insert a curl command, which can import/execute automatically and bring the result in a bottom panel, or something like that."

## ✨ What Was Delivered

### 1. Action Button
✅ **Location**: Flow Test Explorer view toolbar (secondary menu)
- Positioned before the test listing
- Terminal icon (💻)
- Label: "Import/Execute cURL"

### 2. Text Input for cURL
✅ **Input Dialog** with validation:
- User can paste complete cURL commands
- Validates that command starts with 'curl'
- Validates that input is not empty
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. Import/Execute Functionality
✅ **Two modes available**:
- **Execute and Convert**: Runs the cURL command and converts response
- **Convert Only**: Just converts cURL to Flow Test format

### 4. Result Display
✅ **Bottom panel integration**:
- Results shown in "Flow Test Import/Export" output channel
- Detailed execution logs
- Success/error messages
- Option to save as test file

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

```
1. User clicks button → 2. Inputs cURL → 3. Chooses action
                                              ↓
5. Views results ← 4. Optionally saves file
```

### Dialog Sequence

2. **Action Selection**: Execute or Convert only
3. **Save Option**: Save to file or just view
4. **Progress Notification**: Shows during execution
5. **Results**: Output panel with detailed logs
6. **Success Actions**: Open file or view output

## 🚀 Benefits Delivered

### For Developers
✅ **Quick API Testing** - Test endpoints without leaving VS Code
✅ **Documentation Import** - Convert cURL examples from API docs
✅ **Test Creation** - Transform ad-hoc requests into repeatable tests
✅ **Debugging** - Execute and inspect responses immediately

### For Teams
✅ **Knowledge Sharing** - Share API endpoints as cURL commands
✅ **Onboarding** - New team members can quickly test APIs
✅ **Consistency** - Standardized test creation from cURL commands

## 🔧 Integration Points

### VS Code UI Components Used
- ✅ `window.showInputBox` - For cURL input
- ✅ `window.showQuickPick` - For action selection
- ✅ `window.showSaveDialog` - For file save
- ✅ `window.showInformationMessage` - For notifications
- ✅ `window.withProgress` - For progress indication
- ✅ Output Channel - For detailed logging

### Flow Test Engine CLI
Integrates via command-line flags:
```bash
flow-test-engine \
  --curl-import "<curl command>" \
  --curl-output "/path/to/test.yaml" \
  --curl-execute
```

## 📝 Example Output
